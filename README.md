# Simple-Java-Logger
A simple Logger that uses a singleton pattern for Java. Uses a python like argument formatting to easily add variables to the log output.

This logger is very basic and is pretty commonly used. It seems like everyproject has something like this in them, however I could not seem to find one for Java. So, I decided to make my own and share it to the world.
